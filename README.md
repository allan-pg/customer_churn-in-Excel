## Dataset
- Total Customers: 6,687

- Poor customer service  
- Product dissatisfaction  
- Price too high

#### Demographic Trends:
- Senior customers have the highest churn rate (38.22%)  
- Younger customers (Under 30) churn at a lower rate (23.00%)

#### Geographic Trends:
- California has the highest churn rate (63.24%), followed by Ohio (34.81%) and Pennsylvania (33.33%)

## Visualizations & Dashboards
The Excel file contains:
- A Churn Reasons bar chart highlighting the most common reasons for customer churn.  
- An Age Demographics Churn Rate graph showing churn trends across different age groups.  
- A State-wise Churn Rate Heatmap to identify regions with the highest customer attrition.  
- A Competitor Churn Analysis pie chart illustrating customers lost to competitors.  

## Recommendations
